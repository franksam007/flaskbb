    side bar menu. Implementations of this hook should return a list of tuples
    that are view name and display text. The display text will be provided to
    the translation service so it is unnecessary to supply translated text.

    A plugin can declare a new block by setting the view to None. If this is
    done, consider marking the hook implementation with `trylast=True` to
    avoid capturing plugins that do not create new blocks.

    For example::

        @impl(trylast=True)
        def flaskbb_tpl_profile_settings_menu():
            return [
                (None, 'Account Settings'),
                ('user.settings', 'General Settings'),
                ('user.change_user_details', 'Change User Details'),
                ('user.change_email', 'Change E-Mail Address'),
                ('user.change_password', 'Change Password')
            ]

    Hookwrappers for this spec should not be registered as FlaskBB
    supplies its own hookwrapper to flatten all the lists into a single list.
